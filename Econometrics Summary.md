Before/after comparisons may under/overestimate treatment effects due to naive counterfactuals (pokon example).

Naive counterfactuals:

-  Before/After comparison
-  Cross-sectional comparison (selection bias)

Selection bias = omitted variable bias

Potential outcomes:

-  Outcome for subject/group when treated
-  Outcome for subject/group when not treated

Problem of causal interference: **only one potential outcome is observed**

Possible solution: perfectly comparable control group as proxy for the unobserved potential outcome. 

Selection bias may be caused by self-selection

And omitted variable should:

1.  differ between treatment and control groups.
2.  related to both the outcome and treatment variable. 
3.  be unobserved.

Individual *i* has two potential outcomes:

1. $Y_{1i}$: With treatment
2. $Y_{0i}$: Without treatment

The causal effect of being subjected to treatment now becomes: $Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}$

Comparable control groups are generated through **randomized trial**.

*Check for balance:* after randomization, are differences in characteristics of control and treatment group statistically significantly different from zero? Lack of balance is an indication of failure of randomization. 

*Statistical significance $\neq$ economic significance*

Is the effect small or large? \\[100\%\cdot\widehat{\beta} \bigm/ baseline\  mean\ of\ outcome\ variable \\]

Mechanism experiment to:

1. Single out _one_ mechanism and see how strongly it works 
2. As a _screening device_
